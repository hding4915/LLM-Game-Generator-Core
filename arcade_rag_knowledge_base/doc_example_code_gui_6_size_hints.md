# GUI Size Hints

This example shows how to use size hints to control the size of a GUI element.

The `size_hint` property is a tuple of two values.
The first value is the width, and the second value is the height.
The values are in percent of the parent element.
For example, a size hint of (0.5, 0.5) would make the element half
the width and half the height of the parent element.
