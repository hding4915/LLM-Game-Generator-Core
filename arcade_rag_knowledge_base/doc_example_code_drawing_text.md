This example shows an easy but very slow way to draw text.

Its main benefit is ease of use. More complicated approaches
with :py`arcade.Text` objects can run thousands of times
faster.

* See drawing_text_objects for a medium-performance approach
* See drawing_text_objects_batch if you want the best performance
  possible
