# Shaders - Shadertoy


Shaders are small programs which specify how graphics hardware should
draw & shade objects. They offer power, flexibility, and efficiency far
beyond what you could achieve using shapes or :py`~arcade.Sprite`
instances alone. The tutorials below serve as an introduction to shaders.

   shaders. Shadertoy shaders only use the pixel shader and will do everything
   in "screen space". There are other shaders using geometry and more generic compute
   processing. Arcade supports these as well, but they are not covered in this tutorial.
