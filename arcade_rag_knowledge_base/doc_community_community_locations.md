# Community Locations

## Community Standards


   <blockquote><i>"Be excellent to each other"</i></blockquote>

The Arcade community welcomes everyone from beginners to OpenGL experts.

You should strive to uphold the following goals regardless of a
user's age or skill level:

* Be kind by assuming good intentions
* Be patient, especially with beginners
* Be respectful of others

## Where to Post

Most community activity is in one of two places:

* The `Arcade Discord`_ server is the most active spot
* The `Arcade Github`_ repository hosts code and issues

If you're unsure, the Discord is the best place to ask questions.
This includes changes such as new features, or just getting help <how-to-get-help>.

## Other Locations

Arcade has a presence on the platforms below, but they're not very active as
of Summer 2024:

* `r/pythonarcadde <Reddit>`_ on Reddit
* `@ArcadeLibrary <Twitter>`_ on x.com (formerly Twitter)
