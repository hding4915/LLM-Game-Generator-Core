If you work with grids much, you'll find this to be slow. You may want to look
at:

* array_backed_grid_buffered - faster and uses buffered shapes
* array_backed_grid_sprites_1 - super-fast and uses sprites. Resyncs to number grid in one function call
* array_backed_grid_sprites_2 super-fast and uses sprites. Keeps a second 2D grid of sprites to match 2D grid of numbers
