# Drawing & Using Sprites

Most games built with Arcade will use sprites and sprite lists to draw image
data. This section of the programming guide will help you achieve that by
covering:

* What sprites & sprite lists are
* The essentials of how to use them
* How to get started with images
* Non-drawing features such as collisions
* Overviews of various advanced techniques

Beginners should start by reading & following pg_spritelists page
(~10 minute read). If you get stuck, see how-to-get-help.

I'm Impatient!

Beginners should at least skim pg_spritelists (~10 minute read),
but you can skip to the tutorials and full example code if you'd like:

* pg_spritelists_minimal_sprite_drawing
* Arcade's Sprite Examples <sprites>
* Arcade's Simple Platformer Tutorial <platformer_tutorial>
