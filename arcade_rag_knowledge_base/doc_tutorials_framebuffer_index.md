# Working With FrameBuffer Objects

Start with a simple window:

    :caption: Starting template
    :linenos:

Then create a simple program with a frame buffer:

    :caption: Pass-through frame buffer
    :linenos:

Now, color everything that doesn't have an alpha of zero as green:

    :caption: Pass-through frame buffer
    :linenos:

Something about passing uniform data to the shader:
