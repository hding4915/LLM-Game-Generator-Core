# How to Submit Changes

First, you should open up an issue or enhancement request on
the `Github Issue List`_.

Next, `create your own fork`_ of the Arcade library.
The Arcade library is at:

https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade

Follow the how-to-compile on how to build the code.

You can submit changes with a "pull request." With a pull request you ask
that another repository (in this case the Arcade library) "pull" your
changes into the main code base.

If you aren't familiar with how to do pull requests, the
`Stack Overflow discussion on pull requests`_ is good.
